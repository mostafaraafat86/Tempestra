# ü§ñ Weather Chatbot Feature

## Overview

The Weather Chatbot is an intelligent assistant that provides personalized weather advice for farmers and fishermen based on NASA weather data. It can understand natural language queries and provide location-specific recommendations.

## Features

### üåæ For Farmers
- **Crop Planning**: Advice on planting, harvesting, and irrigation timing
- **Weather Suitability**: Analysis of temperature, precipitation, and wind conditions
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluation of weather risks for farming activities
- **Location-Specific**: Tailored advice based on farm location

### üé£ For Fishermen
- **Safety Assessment**: Wind and weather conditions for safe fishing
- **Visibility Analysis**: Weather conditions affecting fishing visibility
- **Maritime Conditions**: Specific advice for sea fishing and cruising
- **Location-Aware**: Recommendations based on fishing location (e.g., Red Sea, Mediterranean)

### üó£Ô∏è Natural Language Processing
- **Intent Recognition**: Understands farming vs fishing queries
- **Location Extraction**: Automatically detects location mentions
- **Context Awareness**: Maintains conversation context
- **Smart Prompting**: Asks for location when needed

## How It Works

### 1. Query Analysis
The chatbot analyzes user queries to:
- Identify user type (farmer, fisherman, general)
- Extract location information
- Determine intent (suitability check, timing advice, risk assessment)
- Assess if location information is needed

### 2. Weather Analysis
When location is provided, the chatbot:
- Fetches historical NASA weather data
- Analyzes relevant parameters (temperature, precipitation, wind)
- Compares against activity-specific thresholds
- Calculates suitability scores

### 3. Response Generation
The chatbot generates personalized responses including:
- Weather condition analysis
- Activity-specific recommendations
- Risk assessments
- Location prompts when needed
